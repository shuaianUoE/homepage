Welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate at the [Laboratory of Foundations of Computer Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/people) (LFCS), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Yang. I will graduate in August 2024 and plan to continue working with Professor Yang as a research associate.

My research focuses on scaling and explaining DBMS for ML powered applications. the resurgence of ML services provided by big companies in recent years has been expeditiously reshaping the database applications, enabling them to easily take advantage of model prediction services
and be significantly more adaptive and intelligent. However, this movement
causes these applications to be less transparent, rendering database vendors incapable
of offering reliable explanations to their customers. In
addition, the increasing popularity of ML features rapidly boosts the scale
of applications while the underlying legacy database systems are struggling to scale out, causing tension between the application load and database system. My work aims to address these challenges of explainability and scalability in ML-powered database applications.

Prior to my PhD at the University of Edinburgh, I worked as an algorithm engineer at JD.com for two years following my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Nankai University in 2018.
